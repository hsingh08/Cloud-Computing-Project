• Goal-:
• As today in the modern era as everything is online and one click so why not parking. So, We intend to design an application for the users which can facilitate the ease of parking. It not only shows the nearby API parking availability but also allows user to reserve the for them in advance. Once user reserve parking spot he or she is notified by an email and there will be a secure payment link in that email with which users can
Pay in advance to confirm their booking. We also intend to design eye catching user interface which not only makes an application attractive but also one click. The database for this application stores the record for all the users who get registered. The database gets up updated as no of users increases. This data base can be stored locally or globally.
